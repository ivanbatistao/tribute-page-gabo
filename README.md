# Tribute Page - Gabriel García Márquez (Gabo)

This project was done as part of my practice of HTML & CSS. I used semantic HTML5, CSS3 (you'll see a bit of flex), Git and VSCode.

Check it out: [Tribute Page Gabo](https://ivanbatistao.github.io/tribute-page-gabo/)

You can also go and check the [HTML document](https://github.com/ivanbatistao/tribute-page-gabo/blob/main/index.html) and [CSS document](https://github.com/ivanbatistao/tribute-page-gabo/blob/main/css/styles.css).


Thanks for taking the time to check this project.

All feedback is welcome!
